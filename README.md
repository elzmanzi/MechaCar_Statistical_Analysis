# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
analyze data with R, use linear regression, p-test and r value to draw conclusion

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Suspension Coil Summary
- summary that addresses the design specification requirement for all the manufacturing lots and each lot individually

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

Determine if the PSI across all manufacturing lots is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

After calculation the t-test, Assuming the significance level is 0.05 percent, our p-value is greater than the significance level, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and state that the two means are not statistically different.

By generating 50 sample in our dataset, and we assume that the significance level of 0.05%, The p-value is above the assumed significance level.
with p-value above the significance level, there is not enough evidedence to reject null hypothesis. We can say that two samples are not statistically diferent.
